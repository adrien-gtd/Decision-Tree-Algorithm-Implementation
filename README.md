# Decision Tree Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This project implements an algorithm for constructing decision trees capable of handling various types of data, including binary, categorical, and continuous data. The algorithm is designed to effectively manage both static datasets (unchanging over time) and dynamic datasets (subject to updates). It was developed as a part of coursework at Telecom Paris.

## Features

- Construction of decision trees for binary, categorical, and continuous data types
- Handling of both static and dynamic datasets
- Scalability for large datasets
- Customizable parameters for optimal tree construction
